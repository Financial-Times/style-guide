# FT Design & UX team

All instructions in this guide are designed to help developers, product managers and digital agencies to get a handle on what the layout rules are for presenting FT content.

While the <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components">Origami Registry</a> is a resource with all components listed and implementation rules the UI Style Guide explains the rules on layout and design.

If you would like to contact anyone to get more details on anything in the style guide please contact the FT Design and UX team on the general email design@ft.com entitled Origami Query.

**Dan Skinner** - Head of Design and UX
