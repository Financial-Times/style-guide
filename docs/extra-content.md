##Right-hand Rail
On FT.com there is a column to the right of the page which is known as the "Right-hand Rail". All ancillary content some related to the article and some promotional appears in this column. Modules are stacked on top of each other as in the example below.

The modules can contain lists, article links, promo graphics or links to third party services. it is important to keep the padding, fonts, keading and spacing coherent on on-brand. Please use Origami's <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-typography">typography</a> component to keep all these type styles correct.

The current Right-hand Rail on FT.com is aligned to a legacy grid but you can use the Origami<a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-grid">grid</a> to create your own custom width.
