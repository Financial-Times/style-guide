The FT site width is 972px. All page components are designed to fit within the FT grid. For example the right-hand rail (RHR) is always 6 divisions wide. The grid consists of 16 divisions 42px wide with 20px gutter between each. When creating new module, widgets or components make sure your widths conform to the FT grid. Always use 20px gutter's between items.

#Modules
A module is a container that holds a piece of content. They exist in the Main Content Column or in the Right-hand Rail (RHR) column.

All modules have one Velcro unit of space (30px) at the bottom.


##Main Content Column Modules
There are many different types of element that only appear in the Main Content Column. Page title, Secondary module, Content bundle and Midriff are the most common, see below

####Page title (Primary Level)
These are used on non-article pages to give the page a name. Note: Do not use standard article titles to create page titles for non-article pages. This referred to as a primary level item.

####Secondary module title (Secondary Level)
These appear most commonly on the homepage and different section home pages on the site (e.g. World, Companies, Markets, Global Economy etc). Section homepages are referred to as “FT index pages”. 

On the Homepage for example the More Stories, Multimedia and Offers module use this style. See example below

####Content bundle title (Tertiary Level)
This title is a collection of stories or content about a similar subject or a series of content that is deemed editorially to be relevant to with each other. The example below shows a list of columnists but this could also be stories or anything else.

(show example Could be a video)

####Untitled content bundle (Tertiary Level)
This is a list of content which wont necessarily have a title. There are already a few types in existence, examples below; midriff and lists

####Midriff
A midriff is an small area that interrupts a list of articles to add some variation to the page layout. Midriffs are used to surface other content often unrelated to what’s on the page (but not always). The example below holds a list of articles from the UK section in the first column the left (A) and a single page Special Report in the second column on the right (B)

These modules are stacked on top of each other on the right-hand side of the page. They are always 6 grid columns wide or 342px. There are 2 types.

####Standard module header
