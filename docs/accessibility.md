##What is Web accessibility?

Web accessibility means making a website, digital product or app workable for a person with a disability. It's essentially the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing and reading websites. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.

##Why is accessibility important?
The Web from its inception was meant to be for everyone and accessible by everybody. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help people with disabilities more actively participate in society.
