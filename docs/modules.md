# Grid

The FT site width is 972px. All page components are designed to fit within the FT grid. For example the right-hand rail (RHR) is always 6 divisions wide. The grid consists of 16 divisions 42px wide with 20px gutter between each. When creating new module, widgets or components make sure your widths conform to the FT grid. Always use 20px gutter's between items.
