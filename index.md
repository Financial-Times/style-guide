##Origami Grid

The Origami grid is designed to be responsive and works on a 12 column system. Margins and gutter widths between each column is controlled by the grid. Resizing and formatting is accounted for as you reduce the page width down through the FT’s various breakpoints.

For technical implementation, setup and general paramters please see <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-grid@2.0.8">Origami o-grid module.</a>

Below is a demo link of the grid with column displayed. There are a few key design characteristics. The gutters are 20 pixels and page margins on left and right alter depending on the screen size.

##links
__Standard Links__

##Colour pallette

The FT's signature colour is pink. It's been the colour of the paper for over 125 years. The online pink though is actually shade of beige. It has been chosen as the best colour to pairing with the FT pink newsprint hue. This colour has come to be a key brand signal marking the FT out from other products. As such, it is strongly suggested that you use FT pink when creating your design, product or app. 

There are also a host of other colours in the FT's digital colour pallette. They are broken down into three principal groupings. All these colours can be retrieved from the <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors@2.3.6">Origami o-color module.</a>

###Common colours

**FT Pink** - the background colour for FT.com, webapp and all FT products. FT pink is crucial and should be the first requirement when designing FT digital products.

**FT Blue** - used for links only

**Tint 1** - used to make the background colour of the Right-hand Rail 

**Tint 3** - used to make the header modules in the Right-hand Rail 


###Tints
Use a combination of these tints to create your page elements and differentiate different page elements of your design. These tints are carefully slected to compliment the FT pink backgruond colour. If you are looking to encapsulate certain page elements with borders, boxes or background colours you must use these tints. THese tints are preferred to the FT grey pallette.

Below is a table of the FT tints following the numbering system.

###Other colours

__Claret__ is used for Special Report titles. This colour can be used as an accent colour for elements and designs that specifically need to stand-out strongly. FT Tints are used to seperate page elements and designs. Be warned that the Claret is used sparingly so don’t over-do it. 

__Green__ is typically used for arrows, positive actions on marketing pages

__Red__ is used for warnings and emergency messaging

##spacing

A standard FT spacing unit is 20px.

Whenlaying out your product please give enough room to the page elements. Vertical spacing between elements should be consistent. Products presented with varying gaps between elements often look like mistakes with users sublimilally picking it up. The FT is premium brnad so you should strive to uphold accurate, consistent and neat presentation. Using our Ft spacing unit will help you achieve this.

Horizontal spacing, gutters and margins should be controlled by the Origami grid if. For vertical spacing you should use the FT spacing unit.






##Fonts
__Benton Sans__

Used for all normal text on general pages. General pages are every page that is not an article.

__Georgia__

ONLY ever used for article text. If at all possible don’t use Georgia Italic.

__Arial__
This is the fallback standard font while we’re transitioning over to Benton Sans.

All these fonts can be retrieved from the <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors@2.3.6">Origami o-fonts module.</a>






##Buttons

__Legacy buttons__

Please note there are a set of <a href="http://http://financial-times.github.io/ft-velcro">legacy</a> buttons widely in use. These are primarly for FT.com and have been deprecated in Origami.

All Origami button styles can be retrieved from the <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors@2.3.6">Origami o-buttons module.</a>

###Origami Buttons

Origami buttons are designed to not be preset with any colour. If your product uses a specific colour pallete you can colour your buttons accordingly. Below are the recommended default settings.

####Standard Origami button

These buttons have hollow colouring and are the default for standard button interactions.

####Call-to-action button

These buttons are only used for pages which require affirmative action. Examples would be on marketing pages, product purchasing pages, sign-up pages and as sign-in buttons.

####Pagination

Used for paging through content

####Toggle buttons / multi toggle

Used for paging through content






##Forms

Forms are designed to be responsive at different screen sizes. It’s very important that ample layout and spacing is given to ensure ease of use on touch devices.

All the form elements can be retrieved from the <a href="http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-colors@2.3.6">Origami o-forms module.</a>

###Text input

We suggest always prepopulating the form field with suggestive text to help the user.

###Two scales

There are two scales of input available in Origami the “default” size should suffice for most platforms while the “Big”* scale is used for devices and scenarios where touch-based UI is required.

*may change to better name


###Input fields

When laying out input fields in a form all fields must stacked vertically. This is the easiest way to read and complete a form.


###Multi column layout

When creating a form it's recommended to use a single column

###Input errors

These will always appear underneath the input field. Any information you need to present to explain an error should be written into the redbox displayed below the input field.

###Page errors

Text to go here

##Overlays

###Origami overlays

There is one universal overlay container that all overlays now use. This is a simpler and consistent design than previous. The content inside overlays can vary depending on your products need.
